semi-autonomous robots

Hidden markov models are widely usen

propose adding a mechanism that pretriggers the initial parts of the robotâ€™s movement primitive, based on training data that reveal the most likely sequence of future actions

i think the system has various possible sequences and makes predictions considering them

In the case the recognized human action differs from the
pre-triggered action, the robot must give priority to the hu-
man decision. This means that the robot must then back
off and switch to the recognized human action.
