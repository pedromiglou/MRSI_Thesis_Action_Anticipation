# [<-](../README.md) Anticipative interaction primitives for human-robot collaboration

## Keywords

- semi-autonomous robot collaborator
- interaction primitive
- lookup table of actions

## Objective

- providing a semi-autonomous robot collaborator with anticipative capabilities to predict human actions
- eliminating action recognition delay in the robot's response by predicting the next human action
- the robot should decide wether to hand over a screw or a plate and which plate
- the robot is fundamentally an helper, as opposed to a leader
- as the experience with a given user grows, it learns the pattern in which the parts are being assembled

## Sensors

- tracking the hand using optical markers
- probably only a camera

## Methods

- use a lookup table containing variations of assembly sequences, previously demonstrated by different users
- use nearest neighbor sequence in the table that matches the actual sequence of human actions
- uses a probabilistic representation of interaction primitives to generate robot trajectories
- hand-coded a contingency trajectory that allows the robot to return from the erroneous pre-grasp and switch to the correct grasping

## Critics

- A limitation of nearest neighbor in our problem is that all possible sequences that the human may ever execute, must be present on the table. If the human executes a sequence that is not in the lookup table, the robot will opt for the closest but not exact one. Potentially, such a sequence may have many disagreements with the way the user wants to assemble the toolbox. As a consequence, the switching and execution to the correct action—which takes longer than simply not predicting the human—may lead to frustrating interactions.

- It uses a simple algorithmn to match human actions without learning but suggests good ideas even for a learning based project such as a lookup table.
