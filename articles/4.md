# [<-](../README.md) Prediction‐Based Human‐Robot Collaboration in Assembly Tasks Using a Learning from Demonstration Model

## Keywords

- human‐robot collaboration
- action prediction
- assembly
- spatiotemporal
- deep learning
- human demonstration
- robot learning

## Objective

- providing the required pieces to the human worker
- human demonstration learning
- human intention prediction

## Sensors

- camera

## Methods

- convLSTM to predict intention
- tracking module based on an extended Kalman filter
- CNN to recognize the part needed
- ROS Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) to handle the trajectory planning jobs
- in terms of security, there are speed limits on the robot, it normally stays out of the human safety zone and when moving close to the human, the robot moves at a speed that is slow enough to raise no risk

## Critics

- presented an extensive description of all the algorithms involved in the robot movement
- used a smaller scale example
- used random people to test and show that this approach makes the assembly faster than with voice commands
