# [<-](../README.md) Learning to Anticipate Egocentric Actions by Imagination

## Keywords

- Action anticipation
- ImagineRNN
- Egocentric Action Anticipation
- Temporal Segment Networks (TSN)

## Objective

- Given an egocentric video sequence denoted as observed video, we aim to predict the future action that happens after a time period of T seconds, whereas the time T is known as the anticipation time.

## Sensors

- RGB and optical flow streams
- images/videos from public datasets

## Methods

- decompose the action anticipation into a series of future feature predictions
- ImagineRNN
- Temporal Segment Networks (TSN)

## Critics

- generates the future image which is unecessary in this case
- it is not in an industrial setting
