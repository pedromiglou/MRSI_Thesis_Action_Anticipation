# [<-](../README.md#articles) Action Anticipation By Predicting Future Dynamic Images

## Keywords

- Action anticipation
- Human-Robot Collaboration
- Prediction
- Generation
- Motion Representation
- Dynamic Image

## Objective

- predict future motion representation

## Sensors

- datasets of videos

## Methods

- convolutional autoencoder network to generate the next motion image
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process generated motion images and make action predictions for the future
- another CNN to analyze static images

## Critics

- it is a different idea but combining the motion image plus the images might give good results
