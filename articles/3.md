# [<-](../README.md) Anticipation in Human-Robot Cooperation: A recurrent neural network approach for multiple action sequences prediction

## Keywords

- Action anticipation
- gaze and body posture
- RNN

## Objective

- robot must predict human actions and intent, and understand human non-verbal cues: gaze and body posture

## Sensors

- datasets of rgb images with some markers

## Methods

- use of gaze and body pose cues as a means of predicting human action through a feature selection method
- encoder-decoder recurrent neural network topology in the discrete action prediction problem
- predicting multiple action sequences as a means of estimating the stochastic reward in a human robot cooperation scenario

## Critics

- showed the importance of both body pose and gaze cues for the accurate prediction of human intent
- proves that gaze allows for an earlier prediction
- it uses deep learning with a pruning method to reduce possible actions
- the metric used was the F1 score which works well even with unbalanced data
