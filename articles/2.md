# [<-](../README.md) Action anticipation for collaborative environments: The impact of contextual information and uncertainty-based prediction

## Keywords

- Action anticipation
- Early action prediction
- Context information
- Bayesian deep learning
- Uncertainty

## Objective

- machines must predict/anticipate future events, and execute actions in a timely manner
- action anticipation consisting of classifying an action even before it occurs

## Sensors

- rgb camera

## Methods

- consider human limbs movement, gaze and object information
- action anticipation as a classification task
- time-based neural network architecture
- recurrent neural network with an adaptive threshold calculated via an uncertainty metric
- use context information to disambiguate similar actions
- use openpose to extract skeleton joints
- stochastic (Bayesian) LSTM model customized to doubt the first solution

## Critics

- it suggests some metrics to evaluate the model
- the article takes a model centric approach to solving a problem since it is an outside dataset
- it compares several models statistics ensuring that the new solution is the best
