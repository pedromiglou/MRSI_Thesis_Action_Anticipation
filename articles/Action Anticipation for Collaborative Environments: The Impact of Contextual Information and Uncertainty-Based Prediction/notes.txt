limb movements are not enough

tried to consider gaze and object information over time

action anticipation as a classification task

action anticipation consists of classifying a task before it occurs.

objectsâ€™ position, the relation between hands and object/person and the type of object manipulated, can offer as much or even more information than only movement. 

need CNN to classify using the difference between 2 images

only use information from rgb sensors

Bayesian neural network to have a certain uncertainty

proposed architecture divided into three main steps: feature extraction and selection, feature embedding, and classification model.
