# [<-](../README.md) Fostering short-term human anticipatory behavior in human-robot collaboration

## Keywords

- Human-robot collaboration
- Anticipatory behavior
- Adaptive behavior
- Visual cues

## Objective

- fostering human anticipatory behavior towards the robot, through visual cues of the robot’s next move
- robot adaptiveness to the human actions through reducing its motion speed with respect to human movement’s proximity

## Methods / Sensors

- tested by volunteer participants in a Virtual Reality simulation environment created in Unity 3D™ along with a human arm motion tracking system developed in house by the NTUA Ergonomics Lab

## Critics

- innovative idea of making the user know the robot's intent, helping the user have more trust in the robot and therefore decrease task completion time
- even though there were some conclusions taken, it remained limited to testing in VR where the person feels safer
