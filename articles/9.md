# [<-](../README.md#articles) Social Cobots: Anticipatory Decision-Making for Collaborative Robots Incorporating Unexpected Human Behaviors

## Keywords

- Action anticipation
- Human-Robot Collaboration
- Anticipatory Decision-Making
- Intent Inference

## Objective

- handle unexpected conditions:
    - when the human’s intention is estimated to be irrelevant to the assigned task and may be unknown to the robot, e.g., motivation is lost, another assignment is received, onset of tiredness
    - when the human’s intention is relevant but the human doesn’t want the robot’s assistance in the given context, e.g., because of the human’s changing emotional states or the human’s task-relevant distrust for the robot

## Sensors

- camera i think

## Methods

- partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)
- model the human states of being distracted, tired and not capable of fulfilling a task

## Critics

- it covers a topic that most articles do not cover which is what happens when the user does unpredictable actions in the sense that they do not require the reaction of the robot or require a "fallback" action
- moving forward this is a problem that if fixed may increase the efficency of HRC
- there was no deep learning involved
- the sensor was not referred
