# [<-](../README.md) Predicting the Future: A Jointly Learnt Model for Action Anticipation

## Keywords

- Action anticipation
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- ResNet50
- LSTM

## Objective

- predict the future while classifying future actions

## Sensors

- RGB and optical flow streams
- images/videos from public datasets

## Methods

- recurrent Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework
- ResNet50 + LSTM

## Critics

- generates the future image which is unecessary in this case
- it is not in an industrial setting
- uses transfer learning which is uncommon in this theme
