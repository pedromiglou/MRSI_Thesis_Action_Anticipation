# [<-](../README.md#articles) TTPP: Temporal Transformer with Progressive Prediction for Efficient Action Anticipation

## Keywords

- Action anticipation
- Human-Robot Collaboration
- Transformer
- Encoder-Decoder

## Objective

- predict future action categories from observed frames

## Sensors

- video datasets

## Methods

- temporal Transformer with progressive prediction for the action anticipation task
- two modules: temporal Transformer module (TTM) to aggregate observed information and progressive prediction module (PPM) to anticipate future actions
- feature extraction with transfer learning: VGG-16, TS, ConvNet

## Critics

- model centric approach
- approaches the problem that is knowing how much frames are relevant to our classification
