\section{...from the article...}
In this paper, a review of several articles about human-robot collaboration was conducted, and, more particularly, action anticipation.

Regarding sensors and data sources, RGB cameras are predominant, although there is work with others, such as RGB-D cameras or wearables, to a lesser extent.

Regarding algorithms, there was also a particular focus on machine learning, given that most work nowadays takes advantage of the progress made in that field. Supervised learning was the technique that received a greater focus since it is the most adequate to solve the problem in this paper. With the continuous evolution of machine learning, it is expected that the algorithms related to the topic in this paper also evolve and, consequently, give rise to even better solutions.

Regarding safety, this is a topic common to action anticipation since it is relevant to human-robot collaboration in general. However, as it was seen, anticipating the worker's action can help with his safety.

Despite the work already done on this topic, this is still a relatively new idea, with most of the articles being very recent and the oldest reviewed being from 2016.
