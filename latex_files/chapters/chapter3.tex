\section{Experimental Setup}

\section{\acf{ros}}

\acs{ros}\cite{ROS2}\footnote{\acs{ros} 1 documentation: \url{https://wiki.ros.org}}\footnote{\acs{ros} 2 documentation: \url{https://docs.ros.org/en/humble}} is an open-source collection of tools and software libraries used to develop a robotics application. Its main features are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item message broker: every process in the project is a node in the \acs{ros} network and communicates with the other nodes mainly through topics (asynchronous publish/subscribe streaming of data) or services (synchronous RPC-style communication);
    \item code reuse: executables and packages are written to be as independent as possible making the developer able to reuse them in another project;
    \item rich ecosystem: there are several open-source packages that can be easily integrated available to the developer;
    \item scalability: given that the nodes are so loosely coupled, it allows for node distribution;
    \item language independence: nodes can be written in any language since communication is established trough well-defined objects;
    \item data visualization: there are tools to visualize the data in real-time, such as Rviz;
    \item simulator support: \acs{ros} has support for simulators with Gazebo being the most common;
    \item hardware abstraction: contains driver packages to deal with some hardware devices;
\end{itemize}

\acs{ros} can be used by installing on Ubuntu or Mac OS X systems, and then nodes can be launched from existing repositories or can be programmed in Python, C++ or Lisp with more languages still under development.

\section{Tensorflow}

Tensorflow\footnote{Tensorflow documentation: \url{https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs}} is a platform that can be used for all steps of a machine learning project. Its main features are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item prepare data: load data, data pre-processing and data augmentation;
    \item build models: design and train custom models with little code or use pre-trained ones (transfer learning);
    \item deploy models: helps using models in different platforms such as locally, in the cloud, in a browser, or in mobile;
    \item implement MLOps: run models in production, tracking their performance and identify issues.
\end{itemize}

Tensorflow can be used through its \acp{api} in several languages to adapt to every project but the Python \acs{api} is recommended since it is more stable.

\section{Pytorch}

Pytorch\footnote{Pytorch documentation: \url{https://pytorch.org/docs}} is an open-source framework that can be used for all steps of a machine learning project. Its main features are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item distributed model training: takes advantage of some Python and C++ features to optimize the performance in both research and production phases;
    \item robust ecosystem: there are tools and libraries that extend PyTorch to include features related to, for example, computer vision and natural language processing;
    \item ready for production: it has tools to deploy models with scalability in environments such as the cloud;
    \item cloud support: it has good support in the most common cloud platforms allowing an easier deployment in a production environment.
\end{itemize}

Pytorch can be used through its \acp{api} in Python, Java, or C++.

\section{OpenPose}
\label{section:openpose}

OpenPose\cite{Cao2021,Simon2017,Cao2018,Wei2016}\footnote{OpenPose documentation: \url{https://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/openpose}} is an open-source project that aims to detect key points in the human body, face, hands, and feet from images. Its main features are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 2D key point detection in real-time based on body/foot, hand, or face of multiple people in the image;
    \item 3D key point detection in real-time based on images from multiple cameras of a single person;
    \item estimation of camera calibration parameters;
    \item single-person tracking.
\end{itemize}

OpenPose can be used through the command-line or using an \acs{api} for Python or C++.

\section{OpenPifPaf}

OpenPifPaf\cite{Kreiss2021,Kreiss2019}\footnote{OpenPifPaf documentation: \url{https://openpifpaf.github.io}} is an open-source project that aims to detect, associate and track semantic key points. Detecting human joints is an example of its usage but it is also able to generalize this detection to other classes such as cars and animals.

It can be installed as a python package which can then be imported.
