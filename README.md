## Ideas

use CNN to classify current posture and RNN works with the sequence of postures

use openpose
https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose

having a lookup table of possible sequences so that considering the current state we have a set of possible next states

## Doubts

Even if there are different sequences of assembly actions can i assume that the person can adapt to the action of the robot if it makes sense
