## Anticipation

- Anticipatory System: “a system containing a predictive model of itself and/or of its environment, which allows it to change state at an instant in accord with the model’s predictions pertaining to a later instant” (“Anticipation in Robotics”, 2018)
    - “robots can use anticipation to learn how to control their own bodies”
    - “robots can use anticipation to predict the behaviour of themselves interacting with others, and hence demonstrate improved safety, or simple ethical behaviours”

- Action Anticipation: “classifying an action even before it occurs, by using the partial information provided up to a certain moment in time” (“Action anticipation for collaborative environments: The impact of contextual information and uncertainty-based prediction”, 2021) (mendeley checked)

- egocentric action anticipation: predicting what actions the camera wearer will perform in the near future and which objects they will interact with (Rolling-Unrolling LSTMs for Action Anticipation from First-Person Video, 2021)

- egocentric action anticipation task, which predicts future action seconds before it is performed (Learning to Anticipate Egocentric Actions by Imagination, 2021)

- Human action anticipation, also aka early action prediction, aiming to predict future unseen actions (TTPP: Temporal Transformer with Progressive Prediction for Efficient Action Anticipation, 2021)

- Human action-anticipation methods predict what is the future action by observing only a few portion of an action in progress. (Action Anticipation By Predicting Future Dynamic Images, 2019)

## Recognition
- Action Recognition: “uses an entire sequence of information, which represents one performed action, to associate the observed action to one possible action class” (“Action anticipation for collaborative environments: The impact of contextual information and uncertainty-based prediction”, 2021) (mendeley checked)
